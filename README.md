## Description
Sticker Book is that feeling of nostalgia from your super cool childhood sticker-covered notebook in the form of a Goal-tracking web app!  A reward can be something simple.  And a goal can be too.  With Sticker Book, that reward can come in the form of a sticker. And those stickers can be the simple pleasures that motivate you toward you achieving your goals!

## User Story

As a constant learner with many goals, 
I want to motivate myself to achieve these goals
with light-hearted rewards and step-by-step accountability. 
I want this accountability through a customizable arrangeable Sticker Page,
an ability to add new goals and stickers,
an ability to add new steps,
and an ability to mark my goal as complete!
I also want to see other users goals.
And give them encouragment too!
